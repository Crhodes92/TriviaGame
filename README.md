# TriviaGame

This was my first javascript game I have ever made without much outside help. I'm extremely proud of it even though I'm sure it could be done in a more efficient manner. I used jquery to dynamically generate and time each question then display a gif upon right or wrong answer. Baby steps right? Just enjoy this retro game quiz and look for more to come!
